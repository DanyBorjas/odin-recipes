    <h1>Triple Chocolate Chunk Cookies</h1>
    <img src="../images/cookie.jpg" alt="cookie image" width="500px">
    <p>Large or small, these triple chocolate cookies are 
        crispy on the outside and chewy on the inside. Refrigerating
         the batter for 48 hours before baking is ideal, as this allows the dough to fully form its flavor.</p>
    <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>3/4 cup brown sugar</li>
        <li>1/2 cup of unsalted butter</li>
        <li>1/2 cup white sugar</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of salt</li>
        <li>1 large egg</li>
        <li>1 teaspoon of vanilla extract</li>
        <li>1 1/2 cup of all-purpose flour</li>
        <li>3/4 teaspoon of baking soda</li>
        <li>1 cup milk chocolate chips</li>
        <li>1 bar dark chocolate</li>
        <li>3 teaspoons white chocolate chips</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            
            <p>Combine brown sugar, 
                    butter, white sugar, and salt in a large bowl;
                    beat with an electric mixer until a creamy, deep
                    brown mixture forms. Add egg and vanilla; beat until 
                    mixture lightens and becomes smooth, 10 to 15 seconds.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Mix flour and baking soda together in a separate bowl.
                Add slowly to the wet ingredients until mostly incorporated, 
                but some white traces of flour remain. Fold in milk chocolate,
                dark chocolate, and white chocolate using a spatula, not the 
                mixer. Cover the dough and 
                refrigerate for at least 30 minutes, or up to 48 hours.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F 
                (175 degrees C) when ready to bake.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Divide cold dough into 2 1/4-ounce 
                portions and place on a cookie sheet.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <p>
                Bake in the preheated oven until the edges start to
                 look golden brown and crispy, 10 to 12 minutes. Do not 
                 overbake; the centers will not look fully
                 done. Cool until cookies are set, about 30 minutes.
            </p>
        </li>
    </ol>
