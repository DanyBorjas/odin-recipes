        <ul>
            <li>1 tablespoon active dry yeast</li>
            <li>1/3 cup warm water</li>
            <li>3 1/2  cups all purpose flour</li>
            <li>1 tablespoon white sugar</li>
            <li>1 teaspoon salt </li>
            <li>4 eggs</li>
            <li> 1 cup butter, softened</li>
            <li>1 egg yolk</li>
            <li> 1 teaspoon cold water</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>In a small bowl, dissolve yeast 
                in warm water. Let stand until creamy,
                 about 10 minutes.</li>
            <li>In a large bowl, stir together the flour sugar and 
                salt. Make a well in center of the bowl and mix in the 
                eggs and yeast mixture. Beat well until the dough has pulled 
                together, then turn it out onto a lightly floured surface and 
                knead until smooth and supple, about 8 minutes.</li>
            <li>
                Flatten the dough and spread it with one third of 
                the butter. Knead this well. Repeat this twice to incorporate the
                 remaining butter. Allow the dough to rest for a few minutes between
                  additions of butter. This process may take 20 minutes or so. Lightly 
                  oil a large bowl, place the dough in the bowl and turn to coat with 
                  oil. Cover with plastic wrap and let rise in a 
                warm place until doubled in volume, about 1 hour.
            </li>
            <li>
                Deflate the dough, cover with plastic wrap, 
                and refrigerate 6 hours or overnight. It needs time to chill 
                in order to become more workable.
            </li>
            <li>
                Turn the dough out onto a lightly floured surface. 
                Divide the dough into two equal pieces, form into loaves 
                and place into prepared pans. Cover with greased plastic wrap 
                and let rise until doubled in volume, about 60 minutes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C). 
                Lightly grease two 9x5-inch loaf pans (see Cook's Note to make rolls).
                 Beat the egg yolk with 1 teaspoon of water to make a glaze.
            </li>
            <li>
                Brush the loaves or rolls with the egg wash. Bake in 
                preheated oven until a deep golden brown. Start checking the 
                loaves for doneness after 25 minutes, and rolls at 10 minutes.
                 Let the loaves cool in the pans for 
                10 minutes before moving them to wire racks to cool completely.
